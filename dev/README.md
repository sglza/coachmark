# Coachmark playground

This app is the library's visual test environment. It imports Coachmark from `../dist/index.js`, so the UI always exercises the same build that a package consumer receives. The controls use targeted components copied from the Coss UI registry; they and Tailwind are development-only and are not included in the published package.

## Extending the playground

When the Coachmark API grows:

1. Add the prop and its value to `playground-types.ts`.
2. Add an appropriate control to `components/config-controls.tsx`.
3. Pass the configured value to Coachmark in `components/coachmark-example.tsx`.
4. Add a separate example only when the behavior cannot be represented safely in the existing one, such as a fundamentally different target environment or controlled-state integration. Give each additional example only the controls it needs.
